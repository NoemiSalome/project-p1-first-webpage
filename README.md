# Noemi's first try

This website is built as some kind of a blog i guess. The idea is to have a mainpage (index), which gives an overview of different themes, where questions about that theme can be found. It is thought as an inspiration for talking topics durin an evening with friend, familiy, etc. to get to know a new side of them.


## The problem
I wanted to have different pictures behind the headtitle. But trying to solve it with a header was the wrong choice I guess.
Next step would have been to built linked boxes on the different theme-htmlx to the next theme-html, so that the viewer doesn't have to jump back to the index.

## View it live

Have you deployed your project somewhere? Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
